## Project

The basic idea for this page came together when putting together a basic JavaScript and Selenium testing framework. There were sites listed for testing against and often I found the documentation lacking or the site was gone entirely, this is an open project so other people can request to add items to it.

## Usage

## Technology

The following technologies were used in this project along with VS Code

## Future Enhancement

As I hope this will become a community project, future enhancement will be from myself and the community

## Build

4th February 2021 - Initial build, nothing special here, just making sure JS and CSS is working as expected
